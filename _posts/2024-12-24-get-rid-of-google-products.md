# How to get rid of Google

Create date: 2024-12-23
Last update: 2024-12-23

Ultimate goal: return to free tier.

--

Actions:

#### Google Drive:

There is entrapment: "Drive" file formats must be kept in drive. They're cooked for now.

Goal: isolate "Drive" formated files and necessary shares.

**storages**

* separate "storages" from docs/spreadsheets/etc
* download (organise in own system)
* delete

**"shared"**

* isolate "shared"
* .. no further action

**"Drive" formated**

* quarantine
* figure out what has to stay
* _[to do as problem space substantiates]_


#### Google Photos

Goal state:

* shared stay shared
* remove every other photo

Actions:

* Downloading it all

Notes:

** DO NOT TRUST GOOGLE DRIVE TAKEOUT **

## Google Takeout failure

I started systematically downloading Google takeout. What a scam. It takes days and is notoriously patch and incomplete. Files are missing and disorganised.

If you can download them at all. I've been chipping away for days and it keeps crashing my browser and failing to download. I'll post if it ever completes.

Log:

Dec-21: first request takeouts, ask for 4x different exports: drive, photos, gmail, everything else
Dec-22: start trying to download but browser keeps becoming unresponsive for 10s of minutes
Dec-23: overnight try to download some 10s of packages before browser becomes unresponsive
Dec-24: 
* start of day: browser has crashed. Only 9 out of 103 files have finished.
* try to resume, chrome says "drive is full" despite ~900GB free.
* start new photos export but 10GB (max size)
* start downloading 1 of the new exports
Dec-25:
* 1 export nearly works (got to 9.7GB then was done in browser but not on drive, by resuming it completed download)
* tried to start 2 more and browser became unresponsive, restart browser, resume download, browser becomes unresponsive, new error: "too many downloads"

Conclusion: it is impossible. Quick search suggests this is a common experience. Yes, it's likely impossible, this method is futile.

Photos: downloading manually, just starting at the bottom of history and moving forward. 10% done in 1 sitting. It's going to be work, but watchyagoingtodoaboutit.

## Google Drive Takeout failure

Drive specifically (in my basic experience) it doesn't inlude many many files.

**Takeout doesn't include Google format files!**

eg, spreadsheets and docs. Yeah, counterintuitive for sure.

## Background

### Context:

Current gmail account dates to 2006.

There was more trust then. I let google in. Now there is not trust. Google is unambiguously enshittified. There is nothing that can be done about this. This is is my attempt to extricate myself.

I pay ~$45/year for 200GB. I'm nearly at this limit so have a choice: pay more or wind down. I choose the latter, but this is hard and time consuming.

### Products:

* gmail: 30.56GB
* drive: 44.3GB
* photos: 112.16GB
  
.. the rest: 17.8MB
