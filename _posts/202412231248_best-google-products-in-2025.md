# Best Google Products!

Check out the best google products in 2025!

The answer is none of them!

If I had to do my time over I'd never have engaged.

I'd have paid for a private email service that is not american and will be doing so henceforth.

My recommendations are:

* Proton mail https://github.com/ProtonMail (Switzerland)
* Fastmail https://github.com/fastmail (Australia)
* Tuta https://github.com/tutao/tutanota (Germany)

All of these also include:

* calendar
* drive/storage
* custom domains

They're en-par with pricing to Google (or even a little more expensive), but they are also committed to not being abusive (at least publicly, but our trust for tech is deep in the negative, e2e encryption certainly makes this harder for them though), where Google is publicly committed to being as abusive as possible.

For dedicated photo storage there are probably no good options in 2025. Players are: dropbox, icloud, google, flickr, amazon. These are all american and abusive. 

I haven't tried these but filtered by: not US, encrypted:

* tresorit (Netherlands, AES256) https://tresorit.com/
* jottacloud (Norway) https://jottacloud.com/en/
* pcloud (Switzerland, AES256) https://www.pcloud.com/
* nextcloud (Germany, bounties) https://nextcloud.com/
* teamdrive (Germany, AES256) https://teamdrive.com/
* cloudme (Sweden) https://www.cloudme.com/en
* mega (NZ, AES128) https://mega.nz/
* powerfolder (Germany, AES) https://www.powerfolder.com/
