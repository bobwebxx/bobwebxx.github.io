Actions:

#### Google Drive:

There is entrapment: "Drive" file formats must be kept in drive. They're cooked for now.

Goal: isolate "Drive" formated files and necessary shares.

**storages**

* separate "storages" frpm docs/spreadsheets/etc
* download (organise in own system)
* delete

**"shared"**

* isolate "shared"
* .. no further action

**"Drive" formated**

* quarantine
* figure out what has to stay
* _[to do as problem space substantiates]_

Notes:

## Google Takeout failure

I started systematically downloading Google takeout. What a scam. It takes days and is notoriously patch and incomplete. Files are missing and disorganised.


## Google Drive Takeout failure

** DO NOT TRUST GOOGLE DRIVE TAKEOUT **

In my even elementary experience it doesn't inlude many many files.

## Background

### Context:

Current gmail account dates to 2006.

There was more trust then. I let google in. Now there is not trust. Google is unambiguously enshittified. There is nothing that can be done about this. This is is my attempt to extricate myself.

I pay ~$45/year for 200GB. I'm nearly at this limit so have a choice: pay more or wind down. I choose the latter, but this is hard and time consuming.

### Products:

* gmail: 30.56GB
* drive: 44.3GB
* photos: 112.16GB
  
.. the rest: 17.8MB
